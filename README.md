# McApp
This app takes the McDonald's dataset and presents a variety of visualizations. The first displays a list of the ten closest
locations through user input of a zip code. It then displays coordinates on a map. The second gives you the perfect location based
on zip code again and a variety of filters. The third presents a chart of the number of stores by region in the US.
